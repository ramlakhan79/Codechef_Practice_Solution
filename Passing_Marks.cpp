In a class of N students, a class test was held. The ith student scored Aiâ€‹
marks. It is also known that the scores of all students were distinct.
A student passes the test if their score is strictly greater than the passing mark. Given that exactly 
X students pass in the test, find the maximum value of the passing mark of the test.
